# Overview

React Router is a standard library for routing in React. It enables the navigation among views of various components in a React Application, allows changing the browser URL, and keeps the UI in sync with the URL. This project is part of a series of learning projects aimed at understanding and implementing React Router in a practical scenario.

# Features

- Routing Setup: Configuration of React Router to handle multiple routes within the application.

- Navigation: Implementation of navigation links to switch between different components.

- Dynamic Routing: Handling of dynamic routes to render specific components based on the URL parameters.

- Nested Routing: Demonstration of nested routes to render child components within parent components.

# Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Jaykant07/react.js_learning_projects.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```sh
cd react.js_learning_projects/06reactRouter
```

Install dependencies:

Ensure you have Node.js installed. Then, install the necessary packages:

```sh
npm install
```

# Usage

After installing the dependencies, run app:

```sh
npm dev
```

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the application. You can use the navigation links to switch between different routes and observe how React Router manages the component rendering based on the URL.

# Project Structure
